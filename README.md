# Cardiovascular-Heart-Disease-Prediction

I apply my skills in real-world scenarios, I undertook Machine Learning project to delve into the intricacies of data of Cardiovascular Heart Disease. The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset comprising demographic information, clinical metrics, lifestyle factors and medical history of a large cohort of patients. Initially, Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to understand data. In Data Pre-Processing Outliers of Variables were replaced by its respective mean, median or mode. Null values were replaced by mean, median or mode. Encoding was performed to Categorical variable and Scaling was performed for continous variable. Several machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, KNN, decision trees, random forests, Adaboost, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, support vector machines were trained and evaluated for unbalanced Data. After Balancing Data, again Model fitting was performed. The models were evaluated using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score through techniques such as cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalization. According to Accuracy KNN was best fitted model. By prediction it was concluded that their will be less risk of heart disease in next 10 years if Precautions are undertaken.
